# TinyLaF

TinyLaF is a Look and Feel for Java 1.4 and higher. 

This is imported from https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinylaf/

That is a re-spin of the same version offered at: http://www.muntjak.de/hans/java/tinylaf/index.html, just re-formatted and built using Maven.

Aims of this version are:

* Use a text format for theme files
* Package as many themes as I can find
* Update the Control Panel to use a new font chooser.

I am unlikely to publish this to maven central.
